## Welcome to the BikeGuider Project!

BikeGuider is designed to help bikers navigate safely without needing to constantly check their phones. Instead of relying on visual cues, the system uses a set of vibration motors to deliver directional feedback—letting riders know when to turn left, right, or make a U-turn through distinct vibration patterns.

The main idea is to keep things hands-free and distraction-free. You ride as usual, and the vibrations guide you in real time. The system can be paired with existing map apps like Google Maps to fetch route data and trigger the appropriate feedback based on GPS position and direction.

We’re also exploring a few optional features, like:

Pedestrian alerts, to warn about nearby foot traffic

Collision detection, to give heads-up about obstacles

Speed limit reminders, based on your location

Overall, BikeGuider blends basic hardware components (like vibration motors and a microcontroller) with smart software integration to create a more intuitive, safer riding experience.
