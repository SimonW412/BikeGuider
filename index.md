Imagine navigating city streets with complete confidence – no glancing at your phone, no missed turns, just you and the road ahead. BikeGuider transforms this vision into reality.

BikeGuider is a navigation system for bikers, designed to keep you focused on the ride. With handlebar-mounted vibration motors, BikeGuider delivers real-time directional feedback, letting you know when to turn left, right, or make a U-turn -- through distinct, intuitive vibration patterns.

But navigation is only half the story. BikeGuider’s computer‑vision engine keeps you safe by warning you of nearby hazards -- pedestrians, vehicles, even unexpected obstacles -- with tailored haptic alerts. It also syncs effortlessly with Google Maps to fetch live route data and uses a mobile application to provide customized riding experience.
