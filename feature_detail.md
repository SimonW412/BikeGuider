## Features Overview

As mentioned in the introduction, BikeGuider focuses on two key functions: directional guidance and real-time safety alerts—all delivered through subtle but effective haptic feedback.

# Directional Guidance via Handlebar Vibrations

To help riders stay focused on the road, BikeGuider replaces on-screen directions with tactile feedback. Vibration motors embedded in the handlebars gently alert the biker when it's time to turn:

Left or Right Turns: When approaching a turn, the corresponding handlebar (left or right) will begin to vibrate, allowing the rider to intuitively know which direction to go—no screen-glancing needed.

Missed Turns: If a rider misses a turn, both handlebars will vibrate in a short triple-pulse pattern, signaling the mistake and helping reroute the biker toward the correct path.

This system provides clear, non-intrusive guidance while minimizing distractions.

# Collision and Proximity Warnings

Bikers often face challenges detecting what's happening behind them—especially at higher speeds or in busy environments. To address this, BikeGuider supports mounting rear-facing cameras or proximity sensors on the bike. These are integrated into the system to detect:

  Approaching Pedestrians

  Nearby Vehicles or Cyclists

When a potential hazard is detected, the handlebar will vibrate in a distinct pattern on the left or right side, depending on where the threat is coming from. This gives the rider an instant, intuitive cue to stay alert and adjust accordingly.

  Customizable Vibration Settings via Mobile App (Advanced Feature)


To give users more control and flexibility, we plan to develop a companion mobile app that allows riders to:

  Customize vibration intensity and patterns for different types of cues (e.g., navigation vs. safety alerts)

  Choose preferred modes based on riding style or environment (urban vs. off-road)

  Connect to popular navigation apps like Google Maps for real-time route updates

This feature adds a layer of personalization, making BikeGuider not only smart and safe but also adaptable to individual biking preferences.
